        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Dan Li. I have many experiences that has all helped me become a great person. I like dogs; however, I like cats better. Unfortunately cats do not enjoy going for walks on leashes so I decided to work for a company that walk dogs. It was a diffcult job because trying to hold onto big dogs was a workout. This experience has taught me to become more aware, flexible, and persistent. Small dogs were the worse to walk. Not only do I have to watch where I was stepping, but the little dogs would walk all over the place which made all the leashes into a knot. This was frustrating because I had to untangle the knot every minute. Although there were times where I wanted to just let go of the leashes and let the dogs run away, I had to be strong willed and not give into the pressure and stress. <br><br>

        Performing in the San Francisco Symphony was always one of my dreams. The summer of 2017 was the time I got that opportunity. I play the cello and the piece I played is Cello Suite No. 1 in G major, Prelude. It took many years of practicing that song over and over again until I got the right timing and sound. I poured many hours each day to perfect the way that Yo-Yo Ma plays. I am really stubborn about not getting the piece played perfectly which is also my greatest strength. If something is very important to me, then I will drop everything that I am currently doing and focus on that one thing until I am at the standard that I expect to be. Some will say that I am too reckless with my behavior, but I believe that I am determined and dedicated.<br><br>

        Baseball is one of my favorite sports. Which is why I decided to sell hot dogs at the Oracle Park in San Francisco. It was a way to get into the games for free and get paid at the same time. Wearing a uniform all day and yelling out the same phrase over and over is very tiring. This short term job has taught me about sacrifice; in order to watch the games for free, I had to endure hours of selling food. There was a time where my manager held a contest of who could sell the most food and refreshments in one day. This for me was my highlight. It was game time and I decided right then and there that I would be the person to take first place in my manager's little contest. I popped my chest out and screamed out that I had the best snacks and drinks. Once the crowd started slowing down, I decided to give deals to customers if they purchased multiple items, then they would receive a free item with their purchase. I was hustling and sprinting back and forth from the food stands to the customers. I ended up getting tipped so often that I beat all the other vendors by a large gap. Fun experience but I would not do it again. Almost every muscle and my voice died the next day.
